Nothing here yet; in the mean time, try your hand at a sample problem!
The following is Problem 5 from the Washington Math Olympiad (WAMO), written by one of our very own staff members.
Although the difficulty is probably a stretch for the NC(J)MO, it could appear as an NCMO #5 if we were feeling mean :P

Kyle is coloring squares on an infinite grid.
For each square he colors, his *score* is incremented by how many of its \\(8\\) neighbors were previously colored.
For example, coloring the center square below would increment his score by \\(6\\).

Suppose that for all positive integers $n$, Kyle's maximum possible score after coloring \\(n\\) squares is within a constant margin of \\(An-B\sqrt{n}\\).
Determine, with proof, the ordered pair \\((A,B)\\).
