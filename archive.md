Nothing here yet; in the mean time, try your hand at a sample problem!
The following is Problem 5 from the Washington Math Olympiad (WAMO), written by one of our very own staff members.
Although the difficulty is probably a stretch for the NC(J)MO, it could appear as an NCMO #5 if we were feeling mean :P

Kyle is coloring squares on an infinite grid.
For each square he colors, his *score* is incremented by how many of its \\(8\\) neighbors were previously colored.
For example, coloring the center square below would increment his score by \\(6\\).

Suppose that Kyle's maximum possible score after coloring \\(n\\) squares is always within a constant margin of \\(An-B\sqrt{n}\\).
Determine the ordered pair \\((A,B)\\).
