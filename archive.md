Nothing here yet; in the mean time, try your hand at a couple sample problems!
First is a classic, which might be placed at NCJMO #3 and NCMO #1: 
In a galaxy with an odd number of planets, an astronomer is sitting on each planet and observing the planet closest to him (other than his own planet). 
If the distances between the planets are all distinct, prove that there is a planet that no one is observing.

Next is Problem 5 from the Washington Math Olympiad (WAMO), written by one of our very own staff members.
Although the difficulty is probably a stretch for the NC(J)MO, it could appear as an NCMO #5 if we were feeling mean :P

Kyle is coloring squares on an infinite grid.
For each square he colors, his *score* is incremented by how many of its \\(8\\) neighbors were previously colored.
For example, coloring the center square below would increment his score by \\(6\\).

![Diagram](https://ncmatholy.github.io/assets/img/diagram.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Suppose that Kyle's maximum possible score after coloring \\(n\\) squares is always within a constant margin of \\(An-B\sqrt{n}\\).
Determine the ordered pair \\((A,B)\\).
